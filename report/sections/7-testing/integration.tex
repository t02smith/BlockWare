\section{Integration Testing}

\subsection*{Profiles}

Profiles are minimal versions of the application that can be run on external devices for the purposes of testing how my application fares in a simulated environment. The following profiles are included:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Listen Only} A client which will fetch a repository from Git and upload it as a game to the network. Once uploaded it will listen for incoming messages and reply accordingly. This is supposed to simulate an ideal peer.
  \item \textbf{Send Only} This client will never respond to messages but will send them periodically to the peer. This represents a selfish client.
  \item \textbf{Spam} This client will spam the peer with expensive messages, such as requesting a block, and should trigger the client to disconnect the spammer.
  \item \textbf{Unreliable} This client will represent an unreliable peer who will take a long time to respond to messasges and may reply with the wrong contents at random. 
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Deployed Implementation}

\subsubsection*{Distributing Instances}

To prove that the application could work in a live environment, we will need to deploy a set of instances of the application to different devices that communicate over the internet. An example deployment might consist of instances deployed to:

\begin{itemize}
  \item a local machine to initiate tests,
  \item a VPS running on a cloud service provider,
  \item 
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Ethereum Test-Net}

The Library Smart Contract, from Section~\ref{subsubsec:impl-eth}, will need to be deployed to an Ethereum test-net to allow instances of the application, that are distributed over the

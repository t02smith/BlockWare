Centralised video game marketplaces are in a large cost to game developers, are at a greater risk of censorship, and result in brittle ownership of games that is fully dependent on the platform. 
\x
Using blockchain technology, IPFS and a custom peer-to-peer file sharing network this project creates a proof-of-concent decentralised video game marketplace. This application allows for the uploading, updating and purchasing of games through direct interactions between developers and users. 
\x
This shows the potential for a decentralised video game marketplaces and how they offer an alternative to existing platforms that benefit both developers and their users.

\section{Unit Testing}

Unit tests will be written to test individual functions within the application and how they work on their own. This includes cases with:

\begin{itemize}
  \item well formed inputs, where the function should produce the correct result, and
  \item illegal inputs, which should result in errors being raised. 
\end{itemize}

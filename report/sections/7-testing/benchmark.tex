\section{Benchmarking}

\subsection*{Strategy}

Benchmarking tests will be used to demonstrate how the scalability and performance of my application in a live environment, by tracking how it performs in a series of increasingly expensive tasks, ran using a consistent set of hardware outlined in the test specification.

\subsection*{Tests \& Results}

\subsubsection*{Generating Hash Trees}

The generation of hash trees as described in Section~\ref{subsubsec:hash-tree}, can be an expensive computational task depending on two factors:

\begin{itemize}
  \item the number of files (or leaf nodes) present in the hash tree,
  \item the average size of files included.
\end{itemize}

\vspace{1mm}\noindent
Whilst varying the number of worker threads performing the algorithm affects the time it takes to complete, it will not be investigated as the same computational effort is still required regardless of the number of threads performing it.

\paragraph*{Varying File Count}
For each run, we will create a project with $N$ files of a constant size $S=TBD$ and run the hash tree algorithm using a pool of 5 workers.

\begin{longtable}{ | r | r | r | r | }
  \hline
  \textbf{Run No.} & \textbf{File Count} & \textbf{Time (seconds)} & \textbf{Hash Tree Size (KB)}\\\hline

\end{longtable}

\paragraph*{Varying Average File Size}
For each run, we will create a project with $N=TBD$ files all of size $S$ and run the hash tree algorithm using a pool of 5 workers.

\begin{longtable}{ | r | r | r | r | }
  \hline
  \textbf{Run No.} & \textbf{avg. File Size (MB)} & \textbf{Time (seconds)} & \textbf{Hash Tree Size (KB)}\\\hline

\section{Integration Testing}

The purpose of integration tests were to evaluate how the application fared when interacting with various types of peer. Each \textit{profile} will mimic a type of behaviour that could be expected in a real-world deployment and the different types are detailed in Table~\ref{tab:profiles}.

\begin{longtable}{p{.15\textwidth} p{.7\textwidth}}
  \toprule
  \textbf{Name} & \textbf{Purpose}
  \\\midrule\midrule
  \textbf{Listen Only}
  & A peer who will listen and respond to all requests perfectly but will never request anything. This is useful for testing when we want a lightweight client to just download data off of. 
  
  This will also be able to upload a game to the locally running smart contract.
  \\
  \textbf{Sender}
  & This peer will respond to requests but will also periodically send requests. This can be used to show how my application reacts to more realistic peers. 
  \\
  \textbf{Unreliable}
  & This peer will pseudo-randomly not respond to messages or send incorrect data in response. This is used to show how my application recovers from faults sent by other users.
  \\
  \textbf{Selfish}
  & This peer will send requests but will never respond to any. This is used to show how my application handles expired requests.

\noindent
The main outcome from these different profiles shows the need for a reputation system where a user can distinguish between peers that reliably respond to requests and peers that don't. This would help mitigate some of the overhead of timed-out requests or receiving incorrect data.

\subsection{Requirements}
\label{subsec:requirements}


Tables~\ref{tab:functional-requirements} and~\ref{tab:non-functional-requirements} show the functional and non-functional requirements of this project organized using MoSCoW prioritisation. Each requirement is allocated some of the following tags to indicate the area of the application that it may refer to:

\subsubsection*{Functional}

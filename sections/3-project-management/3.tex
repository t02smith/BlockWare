\section{Work to Date}

My work has primarily been on research, looking at how blockchain has been used to build and supplement cloud storage systems as well as how various peer-to-peer functioned and performed. 
I have proposed a design for the application to be built on the EVM.

\section{Plan of Future Work}

My project is now split into the following remaining phases:

\paragraph{Implementation \& Testing}
This phase will use agile-based, test-driven development to incrementally deliver functionally and robust pieces of code. The initial sprint will focus on the underlying architecture and provide a base system for the platform to run on, whilst later sprints will focus on improving and adding new functionality. This will also include a write-up after every sprint of what was accomplished and what wasn't.

\paragraph{Testing Strategy and Results}
This phase will be used to reflect on how test-driven development affected my project and what strategy I commonly used during development. It will also be used detail how my application fared against the tests and any problems that I am aware of with the application that I was unable to fix.

\paragraph{Evaluation}
This phase will focus on me critically evaluating the success of my project as a solution to the problem that it set out to solve. It will be used to compare it as a standalone platform and in comparison to other competitors and similar works.

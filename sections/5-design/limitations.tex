\section{Limitations}

This project will not attempt to mimic any of the social features (friends, achievements, message boards, etc.) provided by platforms like Steam. This may leave users with an inconsistent social experience for games as they will have to rely on the developers own implementations, other social platforms or just not have the features at all.

Like mentioned in Section~\ref{subsec:availability}, the main issue with p2p sharing is about the availability of content. The long-term distribution of a video game will often be reliant on the community, and the incentives provided by the developers, which may leave less popular titles unavailable.

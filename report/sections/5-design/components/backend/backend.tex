\subsection{Backend}\label{subsec:backend}

The Backend contains all functionality required for a peer to use and contribute to the platform. It can be broken down into two major components:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Networking} The creation and maintenance of network connections with other peers over the internet with the purpose of locating and sharing data. See Section~\ref{subsubsec:networking}.
  \item \textbf{Data Manager} This component manages the user's library of games and their downloads. It will be responsible for fetching data from storage for the Networking component. See Section~\ref{subsubsec:data-manager}.
\end{itemize}

\newparagraph
Both sections will interface with Ethereum as appropriate to complete their functionality.

Video game developers will often have to rely on third party platforms for the distribution of their games; this comes at a large monetary cost to the developer and leaves users at a greater risk of censorship and with weak digital ownership that is reliant on the platform staying active. 
This project uses the Ethereum blockchain to facilitate the large-scale distribution and continuous updating of video games that allows developers to directly interact with their users, who will now have true digital ownership.

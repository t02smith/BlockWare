\section{Ethereum}

Ethereum is a Turing-complete, distributed, transaction-based blockchain that allows the deployment of decentralized applications through the use of smart contracts. Ether is the currency used on Ethereum and can be traded between accounts and is used to execute smart contract code on the network. 

\subsection*{Smart Contracts}

A smart contract is an executable piece of code, written in Solidity, that will automatically execute on every node in the Ethereum network when certain conditions are met. Smart contracts are enforced by the blockchain network and remove the need for intermediaries and reduce the potential of contractual disputes.

Gas is used to measure the computational effort of running a smart contract and must be paid before being processed and added to the blockchain. This helps prevent DoS attacks and provides economic incentives for users to behave in a way that benefits the whole network.

\subsection*{Example Use Cases}

Some examples of applications that can be deployed to the Ethereum network are:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Financial applications, such as decentralised exchanges and payment systems,
  \item supply chain management and tracking,
  \item voting and governance systems,
  \item unique digital asset systems, and
  \item data storage and sharing platforms.
\end{itemize}

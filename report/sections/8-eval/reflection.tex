\subsection{What Could Have Gone Better}

\paragraph*{Complexity}
Overall, I felt that this project felt too large and I had to commit an extremely large amount of time to complete the application and its tests. This resulted in a massive codebase.

\paragraph*{Large Scale Testing}
Like anticipated in Section~\ref{sec:risk-assessment}, this application was hard to test at a large enough scale to emulate real world usage.

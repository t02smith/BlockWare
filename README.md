# Using Blockchain for Video Game Distribution

> @author: Tom Smith

Millions of worldwide users enjoy video games, which are large pieces of software that require complex platforms to distribute them. This results in them being generally provided by multinational corporations.
However, this approach often results in these platforms:

- taking a large cut of revenue from developers,
- being prone to censorship from entities like governments,
- relying on a single platform to stay active, distribute games, and maintain a user‚Äôs
ownership.

Modern web technology allows users to build and deploy their own platforms, which can
be made with the users in mind and not financial gain or pressure from governing bodies.

This project was submitted as part of my Part III project for a BSc in Computer Science at the University of Southampton.

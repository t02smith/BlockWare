\section{Ethereum}

Ethereum is a Turing-complete, distributed, transaction-based blockchain that allows the deployment of decentralized applications through the use of smart contracts. Ether is the currency used on Ethereum and can be traded between accounts and is used to execute smart contract code on the network. 

\subsection*{Smart Contracts}

A smart contract is an executable piece of code that is used to automate processes and enforce agreements between two or more parties. This code is then executed by every node on the ethereum network using the EVM.

Gas is a unit of measurement that is used to specify the computational effort required to execute operations on the Ethereum network. Each transaction must set a limit on the amount of gas can be used during code executing, and this is paid using ether. However, this can lead to smart contracts failing to execute due to \textit{running out of gas}.
By tying the computational effort of a smart contract to ether, the Ethereum network reduces the risk of DoS attacks as an attacker will likely not have the funds to perform such an attack.

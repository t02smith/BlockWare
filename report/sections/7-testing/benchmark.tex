\section{Benchmarking}

\subsection*{Strategy}

Benchmarking tests will be used to demonstrate how the scalability and performance of my application in a live environment, by running `expensive' tasks given several different contexts:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Locally} A peer will interact with many other peers being run on the same device,
  \item \textbf{Over devices} A peer will interact with other peers over the internet that have been deployed to cloud services or are running on local machines.
\end{enumerate}

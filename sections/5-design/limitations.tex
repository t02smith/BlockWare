\section{Limitations}

One of the major limitations of this project is that it will not support any of the social features, such as achievements, message boards, friends, etc., of platforms like Steam. Whilst, many of these can be supplemented through social platforms, like Discord, it may provide a disconnected social experience for playing games.

On top of this due to the discontinuous nature of P2P file-sharing, the long-term availability of games is dependant on an active community or the developers ability to upload themselves. This means that as games get older or support from developer is discontinued, a game may no longer be available to download at all.

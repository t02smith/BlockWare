\subsection{Backend}\label{subsec:backend}

The backend for this application was written using Google's Go \url{https://go.dev/} due to its simple syntax, high performance, strong standard library and excellent third parties for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain. The Backend can be broken down into two major parts:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Networking} the creation and maintenance of network connections with other peers over the internet and with the Ethereum blockchain.
  \item \textbf{Data Manager} the management of local data and processing of data received and to be uploaded by the networking part.
\end{itemize}

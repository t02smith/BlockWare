\section*{Requirement Analysis}\label{app:req-analysis}

Figure~\ref{fig:req-generator} shows a mind-map which shows the relationships between primary stakeholders, key pieces of data and key technologies that were expected to be of use for this project. This allowed me to come up with a suitable set of requirements.

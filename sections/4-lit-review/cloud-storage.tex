Blockchain technology can be leveraged for distributed cloud storage to provide both public and private storage. In table~\ref{tab:blockhain cloud storage}, I detail some examples of how blockchain has been used to create cloud storage platforms or supplement existing ones:

  Blockchain Based Data Integrity Verification in P2P Cloud Storage~\cite{yue_blockchain_2018}
  & This paper uses Merkle trees to help verify the integrity of data within a P2P blockchain cloud storage network as well as looking at how different structures of Merkle trees effect the performance of the system.

  Deduplication with Blockchain for Secure Cloud Storage~\cite{li_deduplication_2018}
  & This paper describes a deduplication scheme that uses the blockchain to record storage information and distribute files to multiple servers. This is implemented as a set of smart contracts.

  Block-secure: Blockchain based scheme for secure P2P cloud storage~\cite{li_block-secure_2018}
  & A distributed cloud system in which users divide their own data into encrypted chunks and upload those chunks randomly into the blockchain, P2P network.

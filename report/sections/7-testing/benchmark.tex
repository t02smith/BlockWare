\section{Benchmarking}

\subsection*{Strategy}

Benchmarking tests will be used to demonstrate how the scalability and performance of my application in a live environment, by tracking how it performs in a series of increasingly expensive tasks. The areas that will need to be benchmarked are:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Large Downloads} How does a peer fare downloading and uploading an extremely large game?
  \item \textbf{Many Peers} How does a peer cope with having many concurrent peers all sending messages to them?
  \item \textbf{Hashing Tree Generation} How does a peer cope with generating a large hash tree?
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Results}

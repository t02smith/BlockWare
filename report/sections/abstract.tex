\section*{Abstract}

The video game market is dominated by centralised platforms that impose high costs on developers, limit user ownership of games, and are vulnerable to censorship. This project proposes a proof-of-concept decentralised video game marketplace, that removes the need for intermediaries between developeres and users. Use of the Ethereum network enables the secure uploading and purchasing of games that are distributed across a custom peer-to-peer file sharing network to users.

This project shows the potential for a decentralised video game marketplace and how they offer an alternative to existing platforms whilst benefitting both developers and users. By removing a reliance on centralised architecture this marketplace creates a more equitable, transparent system that can be built, and managed by its users.

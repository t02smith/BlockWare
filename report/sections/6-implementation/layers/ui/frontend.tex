This application will have a GUI where users can interact with the platform and will need to include the following pages:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Library} The user's collection of owned games, where they can view details of each game owned as well as manage their download status.
  \item \textbf{Store} Where user's can find new games that have been uploaded by other users and purchase them.
  \item \textbf{Upload} Where user's can fill in details about a new game and have it be processed and uploaded to the blockchain.
  \item \textbf{Downloads} Where user's can track all of their owngoing downloads.
  \item \textbf{Peers} Where users can manage their list of connected peers.
\end{itemize}

Wails \url{https://wails.io/} was chosen to create the GUI because it allows us to use a reactive web-based framework. This meant building the UI was straight-forward and allowed me to use tools that I was familiar with; namely: Vue.js v3 \url{https://vuejs.org/}, Pinia \url{https://pinia.vuejs.org/}, and SCSS \url{https://sass-lang.com/}.

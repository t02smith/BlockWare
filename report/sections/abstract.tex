\begin{abstract}
Centralised video game marketplaces result in a large cost to game developers, begin at a greater risk of censorship, and produce brittle ownership of games to users that is fully dependent on the platform. 
This project uses blockchain technology and a scalable peer-to-peer file-sharing system to propose a proof-of-concept decentralised marketplace that allows for the continuous uploading and updating of games that allows for users and developers to interact directly.
This project demonstrates the potential of blockchain technology to disrupt the current video game industry, and offers a promising alternative to existing solutions.

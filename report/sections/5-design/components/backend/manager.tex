\subsubsection{Data Manager}\label{subsubsec:data-manager}

This component is responsible for interacting with local storage and managing the user's collection of owned and installed games.
It will interact directly with Ethereum to discover, purchase \reqref{F-M5}, and upload \reqref{F-M1} \reqref{F-M2} games and use IPFS to upload and distribute game assets \reqref{F-C2} and hash trees \reqref{F-M12}.

\paragraph*{Download Order} Each download will have a downloader thread that selects the order at which blocks are to be fetched. The hash tree is used to find blocks that need to be downloaded and enable us to verify the entire contents of the game once it has been downloaded.

	abstract = {With the dramatically increasing deployment of {IoT} devices, storing and protecting the large volume of {IoT} data has become a signiﬁcant issue. Traditional cloud-based {IoT} structures impose extremely high computation and storage demands on the cloud servers. Meanwhile, the strong dependencies on the centralized servers bring signiﬁcant trust issues. To mitigate these problems, we propose a distributed data storage scheme employing blockchain and cetriﬁcateless cryptography. Our scheme eliminates the traditional centralized servers by leveraging the blockchain miners who perform “transaction” veriﬁcations and records audit with the help of certiﬁcateless cryptography. We present a clear deﬁnition of the transactions in a non-cryptocurrency system and illustrate how the transactions are processed. To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst work designing a secure and accountable {IoT} storage system using blockchain. Additionally, we extend our scheme to enable data trading and elaborate how data trading can be efﬁciently and effectively achieved.},

Their security and performance are well studied. This paper concerns recent private blockchain systems designed with stronger security (trust) assumption and performance requirement. These systems target and aim to disrupt applications which have so far been implemented on top of database systems, for example banking, ﬁnance and trading applications. Multiple platforms for private blockchains are being actively developed and ﬁne tuned. However, there is a clear lack of a systematic framework with which diﬀerent systems can be analyzed and compared against each other. Such a framework can be used to assess blockchains’ viability as another distributed data processing platform, while helping developers to identify bottlenecks and accordingly improve their platforms.},

	shorttitle = {Elephant},
	abstract = {Modern file systems associate the deletion of a file with the release of the storage associated with that file, and file writes with the irrevocable change of file contents. We propose that this model of file system behavior is a relic of the past, when disk storage was a scarce resource. We believe that the correct model should ensure that all user actions are revocable. Deleting a file should change only the name space and file writes should overwrite no old data. The file system, not the user should control storage allocation using a combination of user specified policies and information gleaned from file-edit histories to determine which old versions of a file to retain and for how long. The paper presents the Elephant file system, which provides users with a new contract: Elephant will automatically retain all important versions of the users' files. Users name previous file versions by combining a traditional pathname with a time when the desired version of a file or directory existed. Elephant manages storage at the granularity of a file or groups of files using user-specified retention policies. This approach contrasts with checkpointing file systems such as Plan-9 {AFS}, and {WAFL}, that periodically generate efficient checkpoints of entire file systems and thus restrict retention to be guided by a single policy for all files within that file system. We also report on the Elephant prototype, which is implemented as a new Virtual File System in the {FreeBSD} kernel.},

	abstract = {The relative ease of collaborative data science and analysis has led to a proliferation of many thousands or millions of versions of the same datasets in many scientific and commercial domains, acquired or constructed at various stages of data analysis across many users, and often over long periods of time. Managing, storing, and recreating these dataset versions is a non-trivial task. The fundamental challenge here is the storage-recreation trade-off: the more storage we use, the faster it is to recreate or retrieve versions, while the less storage we use, the slower it is to recreate or retrieve versions. Despite the fundamental nature of this problem, there has been a surprisingly little amount of work on it. In this paper, we study this trade-off in a principled manner: we formulate six problems under various settings, trading off these quantities in various ways, demonstrate that most of the problems are intractable, and propose a suite of inexpensive heuristics drawing from techniques in delay-constrained scheduling, and spanning tree literature, to solve these problems. We have built a prototype version management system, that aims to serve as a foundation to our {DataHub} system for facilitating collaborative data science. We demonstrate, via extensive experiments, that our proposed heuristics provide efficient solutions in practical dataset versioning scenarios.},

	shorttitle = {Blockchain Consensus Algorithms},
	abstract = {In recent years, blockchain technology has received unparalleled attention from academia, industry, and governments all around the world. It is considered a technological breakthrough anticipated to disrupt several application domains touching all spheres of our lives. The sky-rocket anticipation of its potential has caused a wide-scale exploration of its usage in different application domains. This has resulted in a plethora of blockchain systems for various purposes. However, many of these blockchain systems suffer from serious shortcomings related to their performance and security, which need to be addressed before any wide-scale adoption can be achieved. A crucial component of any blockchain system is its underlying consensus algorithm, which in many ways, determines its performance and security. Therefore, to address the limitations of different blockchain systems, several existing as well novel consensus algorithms have been introduced. A systematic analysis of these algorithms will help to understand how and why any particular blockchain performs the way it functions. However, the existing studies of consensus algorithms are not comprehensive. Those studies have incomplete discussions on the properties of the algorithms and fail to analyse several major blockchain consensus algorithms in terms of their scopes. This article ﬁlls this gap by analysing a wide range of consensus algorithms using a comprehensive taxonomy of properties and by examining the implications of different issues still prevalent in consensus algorithms in detail. The result of the analysis is presented in tabular formats, which provides a visual illustration of these algorithms in a meaningful way. We have also analysed more than hundred top crypto-currencies belonging to different categories of consensus algorithms to understand their properties and to implicate different trends in these crypto-currencies. Finally, we have presented a decision tree of algorithms to be used as a tool to test the suitability of consensus algorithms under different criteria.},

Blockchain is pushing forward a race of transaction-based applications with trust establishment without the need for a centralised authority, promoting accountability and transparency within the business process. However, a blockchain ledger (e.g., Bitcoin) tend to become very complex and specialised tools, collectively called “Blockchain Analytics”, are required to allow individuals, law enforcement agencies and service providers to search, explore and visualise it. Over the last years, several analytical tools have been developed with capabilities that allow, e.g., to map relationships, examine flow of transactions and filter crime instances as a way to enhance forensic investigations. This paper discusses the current state of blockchain analytical tools and presents a thematic taxonomy model based on their applications.

	abstract = {A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without the burdens of going through a financial institution. Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending. We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network. The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work. The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of {CPU} power. As long as honest nodes control the most {CPU} power on the network, they can generate the longest chain and outpace any attackers. The network itself requires minimal structure. Messages are broadcast on a best effort basis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone.},

	abstract = {The Internet of Things ({IoT}) now permeates our daily lives, providing important measurement and collection tools to inform our every decision. Millions of sensors and devices are continuously producing data and exchanging important messages via complex networks supporting machine-to-machine communications and monitoring and controlling critical smart-world infrastructures. As a strategy to mitigate the escalation in resource congestion, edge computing has emerged as a new paradigm to solve {IoT} and localized computing needs. Compared with the well-known cloud computing, edge computing will migrate data computation or storage to the network “edge”, near the end users. Thus, a number of computation nodes distributed across the network can offload the computational stress away from the centralized data center, and can significantly reduce the latency in message exchange. In addition, the distributed structure can balance network traffic and avoid the traffic peaks in {IoT} networks, reducing the transmission latency between edge/cloudlet servers and end users, as well as reducing response times for real-time {IoT} applications in comparison with traditional cloud services. Furthermore, by transferring computation and communication overhead from nodes with limited battery supply to nodes with significant power resources, the system can extend the lifetime of the individual nodes. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive survey, analyzing how edge computing improves the performance of {IoT} networks. We categorize edge computing into different groups based on architecture, and study their performance by comparing network latency, bandwidth occupation, energy consumption, and overhead. In addition, we consider security issues in edge computing, evaluating the availability, integrity, and the confidentiality of security strategies of each group, and propose a framework for security evaluation of {IoT} networks with edge computing. Finally, we compare the performance of various {IoT} applications (smart city, smart grid, smart transportation, and so on) in edge computing and traditional cloud computing architectures.},

In this paper, we present a blockchain-based design for the {IoT} that brings a distributed access control and data management. We depart from the current trust model that delegates access control of our data to a centralized trusted authority and instead empower the users with data ownership. Our design is tailored for {IoT} data streams and enables secure data sharing. We enable a secure and resilient access control management, by utilizing the blockchain as an auditable and distributed access control layer to the storage layer. We facilitate the storage of time-series {IoT} data at the edge of the network via a locality-aware decentralized storage system that is managed with the blockchain technology. Our system is agnostic of the physical storage nodes and supports as well utilization of cloud storage resources as storage nodes.},

The studies go significantly beyond any previous work by combining per-node, per-torrent and system-wide observations to ascertain the causes, characteristics and repercussions of file unavailability. The study confirms the conclusion from previous works that seeders have a significant impact on both performance and availability. However, we also present some crucial new findings: (i) the presence of seeders is not the sole factor involved in file availability, (ii) 23.5\% of nodes that operate in seedless torrents can finish their downloads, and (iii) {BitTorrent} availability is discontinuous, operating in cycles of temporary unavailability.},

To this end, we conduct a large-scale measurement study of {BitTorrent}, a popular class of systems that use swarms of actively downloading peers to assist each other in file distribution. The first generation of {BitTorrent} systems used a central tracker to enable coordination among peers, resulting in low availability due to the tracker's single point of failure. Our study analyzes the prevalence and impact of two recent trends to improve {BitTorrent} availability: (i) use of multiple trackers, and (ii) use of Distributed Hash Tables ({DHTs}), both of which also help to balance load better. The study considered more than 1,400 trackers and 24,000 {DHT} nodes (extracted from about 20,000 torrents) over a period of two months. We find that both trends improve availability, but for different and somewhat unexpected reasons. Our findings include: (i) multiple trackers improve availability, but the improvement largely comes from the choice of a single highly available tracker, (ii) such improvement is reduced by the presence of correlated failures, (iii) multiple trackers can significantly reduce the connectivity of the overlay formed by peers, (iv) the {DHT} improves information availability, but induces a higher response latency to peer queries.},

	abstract = {Currently, Internet of Things ({IoT}) and blockchain technologies are experiencing exponential growth in academia and industry. Generally, {IoT} is a centralized system whose security and performance mainly rely on centralized servers. Therefore, users have to trust the centralized servers; in addition, it is difficult to coordinate external computing resources to improve the performance of {IoT}. Fortunately, the blockchain may provide this decentralization, high credibility and high security. Consequently, blockchain-based {IoT} may become a reasonable choice for the design of a decentralized {IoT} system. In this paper, we propose a novel blockchain-based threshold {IoT} service system: {BeeKeeper}. In the {BeeKeeper} system, servers can process a user's data by performing homomorphic computations on the data without learning anything from them. Furthermore, any node can become a leader's server if the node and the leader desire so. In this way, {BeeKeeper}'s performance can continually increase by attracting external computing resources to join in it. Moreover, malicious nodes can be scrutinized. In addition, {BeeKeeper} is fault tolerant since a user's {BeeKeeper} protocol may work smoothly as long as a threshold number of its servers are active and honest. Finally, we deploy {BeeKeeper} on the Ethereum blockchain and give the corresponding performance evaluation. In our experiments, servers can generate their response with about 107 ms. Moreover, the performance of {BeeKeeper} mainly depends on the blockchain platform. For instance, the response time is about 22.5 s since the block interval of Ethereum blockchain is about 15 s. In fact, if we use some other blockchain with short block interval, the response time may be obviously short.},

Our analysis of several popular software update mechanisms shows that deployed systems often rely on trusted networks to distribute critical software updates — despite the research progress in secure content distribution. We demonstrate how many deployed systems are susceptible to weak man-in-the-middle attacks. Furthermore, emerging technologies such as mobile devices, sensors, medical devices, and {RFID} tags present new challenges for secure software updates.

A {POR} scheme enables an archive or back-up service (prover) to produce a concise proof that a user (verifier) can retrieve a target file F, that is, that the archive retains and reliably transmits file data sufficient for the user to recover F in its entirety. A {POR} may be viewed as a kind of cryptographic proof of knowledge ({POK}), but one specially designed to handle a large file (or bitstring) F. We explore {POR} protocols here in which the communication costs, number of memory accesses for the prover, and storage requirements of the user (verifier) are small parameters essentially independent of the length of F. In addition to proposing new, practical {POR} constructions, we explore implementation considerations and optimizations that bear on previously explored, related schemes. In a {POR}, unlike a {POK}, neither the prover nor the verifier need actually have knowledge of F. {PORs} give rise to a new and unusual security definition whose formulation is another contribution of our work. We view {PORs} as an important tool for semi-trusted online archives. Existing cryptographic techniques help users ensure the privacy and integrity of files they retrieve. It is also natural, however, for users to want to verify that archives do not delete or modify files prior to retrieval. The goal of a {POR} is to accomplish these checks without users having to download the files themselves. A {POR} can also provide quality-of-service guarantees, i.e., show that a file is retrievable within a certain time bound.},

Blockchain has solved the problem of changing the original low-trust centralized ledger held by a single third-party, to a high-trust decentralized form held by different entities, or in other words, verifying nodes. The key contribution of the work of Blockchain is the consensus algorithm, which decides how agreement is made to append a new block between all nodes in the verifying network. Blockchain algorithms can be categorized into two main groups. The first group is proof-based consensus, which requires the nodes joining the verifying network to show that they are more qualified than the others to do the appending work. The second group is voting-based consensus, which requires nodes in the network to exchange their results of verifying a new block or transaction, before making the final decision. In this paper, we present a review of the Blockchain consensus algorithms that have been researched and that are being applied in some well-known applications at this time.},

	abstract = {Blockchain technology is poised to fundamentally change our online world. This is not some kind of miraculous, cure-all, money-making solution. One specific use of blockchain such as Bitcoin, but rather the fundamental shift for the offline world ushered in by the web with easy to use access to information and the ability to make digital copies of data or content in an unprecedented ease for distribution across the globe. Hence the name, the World Wide Web. That interconnectivity has suffered fundamental problems when it
comes to transactions - {TRUST}.
The fundamental shift that blockchain technology represents is a method for moving way from an attempt to have a central trusted authority in a massively distributed network. But instead to have multiple sources of trust that must all agree, based on an algorithm that this transaction can be trusted as valid. Furthermore, most blockchain solutions offer an immutable and enduring record of a transaction as it is hard for any trusted or untrusted source to change or modify. This presents a completely new level of security, privacy, and {TRUST} to our online world. As you will see throughout this book, a variety of uses, protocols, and standards make up the current blockchain ecosystem.},

	abstract = {In the context of logistics, blockchain can help to increase end-to-end visibility along global supply chains. Thus, it can lead to improved tracking of goods and offer tamper-proof data to build trust among parties. Although a variety of blockchain use cases already exists, not all of them seem to rely on blockchain-specific features, but could rather be solved with traditional technologies. The purpose of this paper is, therefore, to identify characteristic use cases described for blockchain in the field of {LSCM} and to analyze them regarding their mindful technology use based on five mindful technology adoption principles: engagement with the technology; Technological novelty seeking; awareness of local context; cognizance of alternative technologies; and anticipation of technology alteration. The authors identified five blockchain case clusters and chose one case for each category to be analyzed in detail. Most cases demonstrate high engagement with the technology, but there are significant differences when it comes to the other mindful use principles. This paper highlights the need to understand the problem and to apply the right technology in order to solve it. When solving a problem, care should be taken to address a technology’s unique features to ensure effectiveness and cost-efficiency.},

	abstract = {An implicit goal of Bitcoin's reward structure is to diffuse network influence over a diverse, decentralized population of individual participants. Indeed, Bitcoin's security claims rely on no single entity wielding a sufficiently large portion of the network's overall computational power. Unfortunately, rather than participating independently, most Bitcoin miners join coalitions called mining pools in which a central pool administrator largely directs the pool's activity, leading to a consolidation of power. Recently, the largest mining pool has accounted for more than half of network's total mining capacity. Relatedly, "hosted mining" service providers offer their clients the benefit of economies-of-scale, tempting them away from independent participation. We argue that the prevalence of mining coalitions is due to a limitation of the Bitcoin proof-of-work puzzle -- specifically, that it affords an effective mechanism for enforcing cooperation in a coalition. We present several definitions and constructions for "nonoutsourceable" puzzles that thwart such enforcement mechanisms, thereby deterring coalitions. We also provide an implementation and benchmark results for our schemes to show they are practical.},

At present, centralized solutions based on data centers and cloud storage have problems with data-right confirmation and center trust. A large number of decentralized storage solutions are public systems, in which blockchain technology, as a tool for value exchange, does not solve the problems of data verification and system supervision. We propose a peer-to-peer storage system with identity access, which achieves data validation, cross-organizational data retrieval, trusted authorization, and sharing based on the consortium blockchain. Our solution proposes a peer-to-peer data storage scheme based on the consortium blockchain and a set of identity authentication mechanisms compatible with the consortium blockchain. Based on this, we propose a blockchain-based permission control scheme and a set of retrieval, authorization, and sharing processes. Finally, we implemented and tested the system to prove the feasibility of the scheme.},

	abstract = {Interplanetary file system ({IPFS}) is a version-controlled file system in a peer-to-peer scheme that provides a content-addressable block storage model for storing and sharing files in a distributed environment. According to the feature of {IPFS}, we have proposed a blockchain-based framework to share the file using content-addressable block storage in the peer-to-peer model. To overcome the availability, reliability, storage overhead, and another issue of centralized service providers, we have introduced blockchain- and {IPFS}-based distributed storage model that ensures the immutability, integrity, and availability of the resource. In this framework, we are storing the file on {IPFS} and the addressable content (hash) to the blockchain as a transaction. Our proposed scheme can effectively solve the problem of availability, reliability, and storage of a centralized service provider. In this proposed framework, we are storing the academic record of the student (jpg format) on {IPFS} (peer-to-peer scheme). To implement the blockchain framework, we have used python(anaconda), python flask, postman, and {IPFS}.},

In this paper, we systematically review relevant research to understand the current research topics, challenges and future directions regarding blockchain adoption for e-Government. The results show that the adoption of blockchain-based applications in e-Government is still very limited and there is a lack of empirical evidence. The main challenges faced in blockchain adoption are predominantly presented as technological aspects such as security, scalability and flexibility. From an organizational point of view, the issues of acceptability and the need of new governance models are presented as the main barriers to adoption. Moreover, the lack of legal and regulatory support is identified as the main environmental barrier of adoption. Based on the challenges presented in the literature, we propose future research questions that need to be addressed to inform how the public sector should approach the blockchain technology adoption.},

Despite its importance, both in terms of its footprint in the Internet and the influence it has on emerging P2P applications, the {BitTorrent} Ecosystem is only partially understood. We seek to provide a nearly complete picture of the entire public {BitTorrent} Ecosystem. To this end, we crawl five of the most popular torrent-discovery sites over a ine-month period, identifying all of 4.6 million and 38,996 trackers that the sites reference. We also develop a high-performance tracker crawler, and over a narrow window of 12 hours, crawl essentially all of the public Ecosystem's trackers, obtaining peer lists for all referenced torrents. Complementing the torrent-discovery site and tracker crawling, we further crawl Azureus and Mainline {DHTs} for a random sample of torrents. Our resulting measurement data are more than an order of magnitude larger (in terms of number of torrents, trackers, or peers) than any earlier study. Using this extensive data set, we study in-depth the Ecosystem's torrent-discovery, tracker, peer, user behavior, and content landscapes. For peer statistics, the analysis is based on one typical snapshot obtained over 12 hours. We further analyze the fragility of the Ecosystem upon the removal of its most important tracker service.},

The rich applications and semantics of {DApps} inevitably introduce many security vulnerabilities, which have no counterparts in pure cryptocurrency systems like Bitcoin. Since Ethereum is a new, yet complex, system, it is imperative to have a systematic and comprehensive understanding on its security from a holistic perspective, which was previously unavailable in the literature. To the best of our knowledge, the present survey, which can also be used as a tutorial, fills this void. We systematize three aspects of Ethereum systems security: vulnerabilities, attacks, and defenses.

Surprisingly, however, few of the peer-to-peer architectures currently being developed are evaluated with respect to such considerations. In this paper, we remedy this situation by performing a detailed measurement study of the two popular peer-to-peer file sharing systems, namely Napster and Gnutella. In particular, our measurement study seeks to precisely characterize the population of end-user hosts that participate in these two systems. This characterization includes the bottleneck bandwidths between these hosts and the Internet at large, {IP}-level latencies to send packets to these hosts, how often hosts connect and disconnect from the system, how many files hosts share and download, the degree of cooperation between the hosts, and several correlations between these characteristics. Our measurements show that there is significant heterogeneity and lack of cooperation across peers participating in these systems.},

However, traditional schemes store only one copy in cloud which raises problems with data reliability.

In order to solve the above problem, this paper proposes a deduplication scheme which distributes files to multi servers and records storage informations on blockchain. We present smart contract based protocols without the participants of the central authorities to provide secure deduplication. With safety analysis, we demonstrate that our deduplication scheme is secure and reliable under the definitions specified in the proposed security model with acceptable performance through simulation experiments.},

	abstract = {With the development of Internet technology, the volume of data is increasing tremendously. To tackle with large-scale data, more and more applications choose to enlarge the storage capacity of users’ terminals with the help of cloud platforms. Before storing data to an untrusted cloud server, some measures should be adopted to guarantee the data security. However, the communication overhead will increase dramatically when users transmit files encrypted by a traditional encryption scheme. In this paper, we address the above problems by proposing a blockchain-based security architecture for distributed cloud storage, where users can divide their own files into encrypted data chunks, and upload those data chunks randomly into the P2P network nodes that provide free storage capacity. We customize a genetic algorithm to solve the file block replica placement problem between multiple users and multiple data centers in the distributed cloud storage environment. Numerical results show that the proposed architecture outperforms the traditional cloud storage architectures in terms of file security and network transmission delay. On average, the file loss rate based on the simulation assumptions utilized in this paper is close to 0\% on our architecture while it’s nearly 100\% and 71.66\% on the architecture with single data center and the distributed architecture using genetic algorithm. Besides, with proposed scheme, the transmission delay on the proposed architecture is reduced by 39.28\% and 76.47\% on average on the user’s number and the number of file block replicas, respectively, in comparison to the architecture with single data center. Meanwhile, the transmission delay of file block replicas is also reduced by 41.36\% on average than that on the distributed architecture using genetic algorithm.},

As a hash chain with the characteristics of decentralization, verifiability and immutability, blockchain technology can be used to securely store personal medical data. In this paper, we design a storage scheme to manage personal medical data based on blockchain and cloud storage. Furthermore, a service framework for sharing medical records is described. In addition, the characteristics of the medical blockchain are presented and analyzed through a comparison with traditional systems. The proposed storage and sharing scheme does not depend on any third-party and no single party has absolute power to affect the processing.},

Cloud storage like any other untrusted environment needs the ability to secure share information. Our approach provides an access control over the data stored in the cloud without the provider participation. The main tool of access control mechanism is ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption scheme with dynamic attributes. Using a blockchain-based decentralized ledger, our system provides immutable log of all meaningful security events, such as key generation, access policy assignment, change or revocation, access request. We propose a set of cryptographic protocols ensuring privacy of cryptographic operations requiring secret or private keys. Only ciphertexts of hash codes are transferred through the blockchain ledger. The prototype of our system is implemented using smart contracts and tested on Ethereum blockchain platform.},

	abstract = {Cloud is widely used for data storage. A user who has uploaded his/her private or commercial data to the cloud is always keen to know whether the data that he/she has stored is secure or not. Access logs of stored data can be used to trace the integrity of the data. Access logs are also known as provenance data. Provenance data contains private information of users. As provenance data can be used to check the integrity so, it becomes very important to securely store the provenance data. The stored provenance data should be immutable and also unreachable to adversaries, as it contains private information of users. Cloud users will be assured of their stored data, and Cloud Storage Providers can use this implementation to improve their brand value and performance. This paper aims at providing an efficient way to store provenance data securely using Blockchain technology and {InterPlanetary} File System ({IPFS}) so that it is out of reach of adversaries. This paper also proposed a framework through which a user can verify the integrity of its own data. This model is implemented, tested and analyzed using {IPFS} which is a decentralized storage mechanism backed by blockchain to store cloud provenance data and uses publicly available Tierion api to store the hash value of the provenance entries.},

As Mainline {DHT} differs from other systems, existing measurement methodologies are not appropriate for studying it. In this paper we present an efficient methodology for estimating the number of active users in the network. We have identified an omission in previous methodologies used to measure the size of the network and our methodology corrects this. Our method is based on modeling crawling inaccuracies as a Bernoulli process. It guarantees a very accurate estimation and is able to provide the estimate in about 5 seconds. Through experiments in controlled situations, we demonstrate the accuracy of our method and show the causes of the inaccuracies in previous work, by reproducing the incorrect results. Besides accurate network size estimates, our methodology can be used to detect network anomalies, in particular Sybil attacks in the network. We also report on the results from our measurements which have been going on for almost 2.5 years and are the first long-term study of Mainline {DHT}.},

	abstract = {Even though the Internet promotes data sharing and transparency, however it does not protect digital content. In today’s digital world, it has become a difficult task to release a {DRM} (Digital Rights Management) system that can be considered well-protected. Digital content that becomes easily available in open-source environments will in time be worthless to the creator. There may only be a one-time payment to creators upon initial upload to a given platform after which time the rights of the intellectual property are shifted to the platform itself. However, due to the online availability of content, anyone can download content and make copies. The value of digital content slowly decreases, because the value of content can usually be determined through the difficulty of it’s accessibility. There is no way to track the leakage or copyright for the spread of digital material. In this paper, a distributed media transaction framework for {DRM} is proposed, which is based on the digital watermarking and a scalable blockchain model. In this paper, our focus is on improving the classic blockchain systems to make it suitable for a {DRM} model. The {DRM} model in this paper allows only authorized users to use online content and provide original multimedia content. While the digital watermarking is used to reclaim the copyright ownership of offline contents in the event when the contents are leaked.},

	abstract = {The Non-Fungible Token ({NFT}) market is mushrooming in recent years. The concept of {NFT} originally comes from a token standard of Ethereum, aiming to distinguish each token with distinguishable signs. This type of token can be bound with virtual/digital properties as their unique identifications. With {NFTs}, all marked properties can be freely traded with customized values according to their ages, rarity, liquidity, etc. It has greatly stimulated the prosperity of the decentralized application ({DApp}) market. At the time of writing (May 2021), the total money used on completed {NFT} sales has reached \$34,530,649.86\$ {USD}. The thousandfold return on its increasing market draws huge attention worldwide. However, the development of the {NFT} ecosystem is still in its early stage, and the technologies of {NFTs} are pre-mature. Newcomers may get lost in their frenetic evolution due to the lack of systematic summaries. In this technical report, we explore the {NFT} ecosystems in several aspects. We start with an overview of state-of-the-art {NFT} solutions, then provide their technical components, protocols, standards, and desired proprieties. Afterward, we give a security evolution, with discussions on the perspectives of their design models, opportunities, and challenges. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic study on the current {NFT} ecosystems.},

	abstract = {In traditional cloud storage systems, attribute-based encryption ({ABE}) is regarded as an important technology for solving the problem of data privacy and fine-grained access control. However, in all {ABE} schemes, the private key generator has the ability to decrypt all data stored in the cloud server, which may bring serious problems such as key abuse and privacy data leakage. Meanwhile, the traditional cloud storage model runs in a centralized storage manner, so single point of failure may leads to the collapse of system. With the development of blockchain technology, decentralized storage mode has entered the public view. The decentralized storage approach can solve the problem of single point of failure in traditional cloud storage systems and enjoy a number of advantages over centralized storage, such as low price and high throughput. In this paper, we study the data storage and sharing scheme for decentralized storage systems and propose a framework that combines the decentralized storage system interplanetary file system, the Ethereum blockchain, and {ABE} technology. In this framework, the data owner has the ability to distribute secret key for data users and encrypt shared data by specifying access policy, and the scheme achieves fine-grained access control over data. At the same time, based on smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain, the keyword search function on the cipher text of the decentralized storage systems is implemented, which solves the problem that the cloud server may not return all of the results searched or return wrong results in the traditional cloud storage systems. Finally, we simulated the scheme in the Linux system and the Ethereum official test network Rinkeby, and the experimental results show that our scheme is feasible.},

Therefore, in this paper we propose a public audit shared data protocol for cloud storage by using blockchain and Rank-based Merkle {AVL} tree ({RB}-{MHT}) to achieve privacy preserving and batch auditing to reduce system overhead as well as keeping the security of modification record in this blockchain-based scheme. For privacy-perserving, the auditing signature is only related to group management during the audit process and data will be blind by a random value. Furthermore, we prove the security of our scheme and evaluate the performance of it through implementation. The results demonstrate that the proposed scheme is provably secure and efficient.},

The system stores the {IoT} data in a distributed cloud after encryption. To share the collected {IoT} data, the system establishes runtime dynamic smart contracts between the sensor and the data user without the involvement of a trusted third party.

Swarm is based on storage servers, rather than file servers; the storage servers are optimized for cost-performance and aggregated to provide high-performance data access. Swarm uses a striped log abstraction to store data on the storage servers. This abstraction simplifies storage allocation, improves file access performance, balances server loads, provides fault-tolerance through computed redundancy, and simplifies crash recovery. We have developed a Swarm prototype using a cluster of Linux-based personal computers as the storage servers and clients; the clients access the servers via the Swarm-based Sting file system. Our performance measurements show that a single Swarm client can write to two storage servers at 3.0 {MB}/s, while four clients can write to eight servers at 16.0 {MB}/s.},

This paper shortly presents an agile approach for software development of e-business applications. The approach, named {eXPERT}, is applicable to small teams developing projects characterised by often changing requirements, tight schedules, and high quality demands. The present article describes a case study about {eXPERT} approach implementation at software developing company.

	shorttitle = {Test-driven Development},
	abstract = {Clean code that works--now. This is the seeming contradiction that lies behind much of the pain of programming. Test-driven development replies to this contradiction with a paradox--test the program before you write it. A new idea? Not at all. Since the dawn of computing, programmers have been specifying the inputs and outputs before programming precisely. Test-driven development takes this age-old idea, mixes it with modern languages and programming environments, and cooks up a tasty stew guaranteed to satisfy your appetite for clean code that works--now. Developers face complex programming challenges every day, yet they are not always readily prepared to determine the best solution. More often than not, such difficult projects generate a great deal of stress and bad code. To garner the strength and courage needed to surmount seemingly Herculean tasks, programmers should look to test-driven development ({TDD}), a proven set of techniques that encourage simple designs and test suites that inspire confidence. By driving development with automated tests and then eliminating duplication, any developer can write reliable, bug-free code no matter what its level of complexity. Moreover, {TDD} encourages programmers to learn quickly, communicate more clearly, and seek out constructive feedback. Readers will learn to:  Solve complicated tasks, beginning with the simple and proceeding to the more complex. Write automated tests before coding. Grow a design organically by refactoring to add design decisions one at a time. Create tests for more complicated logic, including reflection and exceptions. Use patterns to decide what tests to write. Create tests using {xUnit}, the architecture at the heart of many programmer-oriented testing tools.  This book follows two {TDD} projects from start to finish, illustrating techniques programmers can use to easily and dramatically increase the quality of their work. The examples are followed by references to the featured {TDD} patterns and refactorings. With its emphasis on agile methods and fast development strategies, Test-Driven Development is sure to inspire readers to embrace these under-utilized but powerful techniques.   0321146530B10172002},

With the widespread availability of several large software systems that have been developed using an "open source" development approach, we now have a chance to examine these systems in detail, and see if their evolutionary narratives are significantly different from commercially developed systems. The paper summarizes our preliminary investigations into the evolution of the best known open source system: the Linux operating system kernel. Because Linux is large (over two million lines of code in the most recent version) and because its development model is not as tightly planned and managed as most industrial software processes, we had expected to find that Linux was growing more slowly as it got bigger and more complex. Instead, we have found that Linux has been growing at a super-linear rate for several years. The authors explore the evolution of the Linux kernel both at the system level and within the major subsystems, and they discuss why they think Linux continues to exhibit such strong growth.},

	abstract = {File sharing is one of the leading Internet applications of P2P technology. Given the high number of computer nodes involved in peer-to-peer networks, reducing their aggregate energy consumption is an important challenge to be faced. In this paper, we show how the sleep-and-wake energy saving approach can be exploited to reduce energy consumption in {BitTorrent}, one of the most popular file sharing peer-to-peer networks. We describe {BitTorrentSW}, a sleep-and-wake approach for {BitTorrent} networks that allows seeders (ie, peers that hold complete files) to cyclically switch between wake and sleep modes to save energy while ensuring good file sharing performance. The decision to switch to sleep mode is taken independently by each seeder based on local information about the composition of the peer-to-peer network. {BitTorrentSW} has been evaluated through {PeerSim} using real {BitTorrent} traces. The simulation results show that, in all the configurations under analysis, the percentage of energy saved by {BitTorrentSW} is much higher than the percentage of increase in download time. For instance, in a network with 50\% of seeders, about 20\% of energy is saved using {BitTorrentSW}, with an increase of only 7\% of the average time needed to complete a file download compared to a standard {BitTorrent} network in which all seeders are always powered on.},

Figure~\ref{fig:test-deployment} shows the architecture diagram of the deployment that was used to test this application. Some notes about it are:

\begin{itemize}
  \item The smart contract code is deployed to the Sepolia test-net.
  \item I am interfacing with Sepolia using a node being run by Alchemy. Alchemy provide an RPC URL that we use in the application to connnect to Sepolia.
  \item I am using the Kubo implementation of IPFS that is connected to via a daemon process being run locally.
\end{itemize}

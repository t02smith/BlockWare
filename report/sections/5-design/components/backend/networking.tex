\subsubsection{Networking}\label{subsubsec:networking}

This component will connect users to the distributed P2P file-sharing network, where it will create and maintain a set of TCP connections with other users \reqref{F-M7}. They will communicate by sending structured messages to each other \reqref{F-M8}.

\paragraph*{Peer Identification}
Peers are identified by their Ethereum addresses, which will allow us to view which games they've purchased and are allowed access to. Upon forming a connection, each peer will request the other return a signature for a generated message. From this we can derive their address and public key.

\paragraph*{Peer Reputation}
This application keeps track of how many of our data requests are sent and responded to by each peer. This allows us to favour reliable peers to get the greatest download speed. However, in the hopes to find more reliable peers we will prioritise sending requests to new peers and randomly to existing peers with a lower reputation.  

\paragraph*{Commands}\label{subsubsec:commands}

Structured messages \reqref{F-M8} will typically come as part of a request/response pair involving the sharing of information between peers. Command responses are not awaited to remove unnecessary blocking of the connection channel as a user may be responding to many different requests at once by the same peer. 
\x
Table~\ref{tab:network-cmds} shows the list of commands used by the application.

\begin{longtable}{p{.38\textwidth} p{.57\textwidth}}
  \toprule
  \textbf{Message Format} & \textbf{Description}\\
  \midrule\midrule
  LIBRARY
  & Request that a peer sends their library of game.\\
  GAMES;$[hash_1]$;$[hash_2]$;\ldots;
  & The user sends a list of their games as a series of unique root hashes. These root hashes will map to games on the blockchain.\\
  \midrule
  BLOCK;$[gameHash]$;$[blockHash]$;
  & The user will request a block of data off of a peer by sending the root hash of the game and the hash of the block being requested. The response will be a SEND\_BLOCK message \reqref{F-M9} and if it isn't received after a given amount of time then it is resent.\\
  SEND\_BLOCK;$[gameHash]$;\newline $[blockHash]$;$[compressedData]$;
  & The user sends a block of data in response to a BLOCK message \reqref{F-M9}. The data is compressed using the \textit{compress/flate} package to reduce message size \reqref{NF-S1}.\\
  \midrule
  VALIDATE\_REQ;$[message]$
  & The user is requesting for a message to be signed using the receiver's Ethereum private key. This is used to verify the receiver's identity and thus their owned collection of games \reqref{F-S1}.\\
  VALIDATE\_RES;$[signed message]$
  & The user responds to a VALIDATE\_REQ message with a signed version of the received message. From this signature, the receiver can determine the address and public key of the user \reqref{F-S1}.\\
  \midrule
  REQ\_RECEIPT;$[gameHash]$
  & A user will request a RECEIPT message from a peer detailing the data that has been sent by the user for a specific game \reqref{F-S3}.\\
  RECEIPT;$[gameHash]$;$[signature]$\newline ;$[message]$
  & A user will respond to a REQ\_RECEIPT message with a signed message detailing all of the blocks that the requester has sent to the user from a given game. This will allow for users to prove their contributions to the game developer who could then reward them \reqref{F-S3}.\\
  \midrule
  REQ\_PEERS
  & A user requests the list of peers which the receiver peer is connected to. This will be sent immediately after a peer's identity is validated and will help increase the connectivity in the network \reqref{F-S4}.\\
  PEERS;$[p_1 hostname]:[p_1 port]$;\ldots
  & A user will send a list of their active peers. This will be limited to those peers which they have connected to and thus know the hostname and port of their server \reqref{F-S4}.\\
  SERVER;$[hostname]:[port]$
  & When we connect to a peer, we send them the details of our server so they can share it using the PEERS command.\\
  \midrule
  ERROR;$[message]$
  & An error message that can be used to prompt a peer to resend a message.\\

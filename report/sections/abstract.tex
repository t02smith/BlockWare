\section*{Abstract}

The video game market is dominated by centralised platforms that impose high costs on developers, limit user ownership of games, and are vulnerable to censorship. This project proposes a proof-of-concept decentralised video game marketplace, that removes the need for intermediaries between developers and users. 
The Ethereum network enables the secure uploading and purchasing of games that are distributed across a custom peer-to-peer file-sharing network to users. By deploying a smart contract to the Sepolia test-net, this project demonstrated that it could function correctly and efficiently in a real-world environment.

This project shows the potential for a decentralised video game marketplace and how they offer an alternative to existing platforms whilst benefitting both developers and users. By removing reliance on centralised architecture this marketplace creates a more equitable, transparent system that can be built, and managed by its users.

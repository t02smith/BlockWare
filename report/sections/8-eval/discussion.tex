Due to the scale and complexity of the platforms this project was aiming to replace, this project was never going to be more than a proof-of-concept as to what a distributed games marketplace could look like. 
However, this application does have several benefits over its centralised competitors, namely:

\begin{itemize}
  \item User's personal information does not need to be kept by any party to complete a transaction. 
  \item User's ownership of games isn't tied to one company/platform so it cannot be revoked.
  \item Developer's no longer have to use a middle-man to dsitribute their games so will see greater profits.
\end{itemize}

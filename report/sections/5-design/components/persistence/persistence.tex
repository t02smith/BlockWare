\subsection{Persistence}

The Persistence layer manages how data is stored across the platform using distributed storage. Table~\ref{tab:data} gives a breakdown of the data stored on each platform.
\x
The Backend will use interface functions to interact with these platforms, specifically:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Smart Contract} An ABI file specifies details about a smart contract and allows us to interact with it from code external to Ethereum.
  \item \textbf{IPFS} Using the IPFS daemon and a client library, we can upload and download data to IPFS.
  \item \textbf{Peers} Section~\ref{subsubsec:networking} describes how peers are interacted with.
\end{itemize}

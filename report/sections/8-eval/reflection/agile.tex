\subsection*{Using Agile Development}

The use of an agile methodology alongside test-driven development meant I could incrementally expand the scope of my application and ensure that existing code was tested sufficiently. Separating my implementation into three sprints benefitted me by:

\begin{itemize}
  \item having a smaller set of requirements to focus on at once helped me to feel less overwhelmed,
  \item working on the most important aspects first to ensure I was able to produce a minimum viable product, and
  \item taking time in-between sprints to take a break from the project and prepare for the next sprint.
\end{itemize}

On top of this, using a Gantt chart (Figure~\ref{fig:gantt-chart}) allowed me to have a clear overview of my project timeline so I could realistically gage just how much time I would need for each section.

\subsection{Data Types}
\label{subsec:design-data}

Table~\ref{tab:data} discusses the different types of data we are going to need to store and where they should be stored based upon their properties.

\begin{longtable}{ p{.12\textwidth} p{.1\textwidth} p{.11\textwidth} p{.58\textwidth} }
  \toprule
  \textbf{Data} & \textbf{Size} & \textbf{Location} & \textbf{Explanation}\\
  \midrule\midrule
  Game Metadata\newline\reqref{F-M1}
  & \small100 -- \newline200B
  & Blockchain
  & \small The minimal set of information required for the unique identification of each game. See Section~\ref{subsubsec:eth-data}.

  \vspace{1mm}
  \small This data is appropriate to store on the blockchain as it is public, small in size, and essential to the correct functioning of the application as all users will need to be able to discover all games. 
  \x
  Game Hash Tree\newline\reqref{F-M12}
  & \~ \small15KB
  & IPFS
  & \small The hash tree that will allow users to identify and verify blocks of data they need to download for a game. The user will download this immediately after purchasing the game.

  \vspace{1mm}
  \small This data is public but its size makes it costly to store on the blockchain at a large scale. IPFS will be used for fast, reliable access at a large scale and we can store the generated content-identifier CID in the blockchain instead.
  \x
  Game\newline Assets\newline\reqref{F-C2}
  & \small Variable\footnote{Some games may include many promotional materials, whilst some could include none. Therefore, it is hard to estimate the expected size.} 
  & IPFS
  & \small Any promotional material provided for the game that can be viewed on the game's store page. This should include cover art and a description file but isn't required to purchase or download the game. The user will download this when they first view the game in the store.

  \vspace{1mm}
  \small For similar reasons as the hash tree, this data will be also be stored on IPFS and have its CID stored on the blockchain instead.
  \x
  Game Data
  & \textit{avg. 44GB\footnote{Calculated based off of the top 30 games from SteamDB~\cite{noauthor_steam_nodate}.}}
  & Peers
  & The data required to run the game that is fetched based upon the contents of the game's hash tree.

  \vspace{1mm}
  \small This data is very large and has restricted access so wouldn't be appropriate to store on either the blockchain or IPFS. Therefore, this project will use a custom P2P network for sharing data, which is described in Section~\ref{subsec:design-p2p}.

\subsection{Backend}\label{subsec:backend}

The Backend containts all functionality required for a peer to use and contribute to the platform and can be broken down into two major components:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Networking} The creation and maintenance of network connections with other peers over the internet with the purpose of locating and sharing data. See Section~\ref{subsubsec:networking}.
  \item \textbf{Data Manager} The management of local data and the processing of data received and to be uploaded by the Networking component. See Section~\ref{subsubsec:data-manager}.
\end{itemize}

Both sections will interface with Ethereum as appropriate to complete their functionality.

\section{Integration Testing}

The purpose of integration tests were to evaluate how the application fared when interacting with various types of peer. Each \textit{profile} will mimic a type of behaviour that could be expected in a real-world deployment and the different types are detailed in Table~\ref{tab:profiles}.

  \textbf{Name} & \textbf{Purpose}
  \\\midrule\midrule
  \textbf{Listen Only}
  & A peer who will listen and respond to all requests perfectly but will never request anything. This is useful for testing when we want a lightweight client to just download data off of. 
  
  This will also be able to upload a game to the locally running smart contract.
  \\
  \textbf{Sender}
  & This peer will respond to requests but will then also reflect the same request back. This shows a more realistic relationship between two peers where they both send and receive data.
  \\
  \textbf{Unreliable}
  & This peer will pseudo-randomly not respond to messages. This is used to show how my application handles requests that sometimes aren't replied to from a peer.
  \\
  \textbf{Selfish}
  & This peer will send requests but will never respond to any. This is used to show how my application handles requests that are never replied to from a peer.

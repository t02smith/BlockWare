\section{Discussion}

Due to the scale and complexity of the platforms this project was aiming to replace, this project was never going to be more than a proof-of-concept as to what a distributed games marketplace could look like. 
However, this application does have several benefits over its centralised competitors, which are outlined in Section~\ref{des:benefits}
\x
This project presents interesting ideas surrounding how games, and other proprietary software, can be distributed between its users without the need for an intermediary. Furthermore, making this project open source would encourage community development through updates or extensions, and improve transparency.

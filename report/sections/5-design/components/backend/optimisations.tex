\paragraph*{Ignore File} A standard implementation of a .ignore file should be included to indicate to the hash tree algorithm which files/folders to ignore. This is useful to ignore temporary or non-static files, which contents will vary by user and thus won't need to be distributed. To do this, the uploader adds a \textit{.blockwareignore} file to the game's root directory.

\section*{Abstract}

The video game market is dominated by centralised platforms that impose high costs on developers, limit use rownership of games, and are vulnerable to censorship. This project aims to remove the intermediaries between developers and users by proposing a proof-of-concept decentralised video game marketplace. Use of the Ethereum network enables the secure uploading and purchasing of games that are distributed across a large peer-to-peer file sharing network to users.

This project shows the potential for a decentralised video game marketplace and how they offer an alternative to existing platforms whilst benefitting both developers and users. By removing a reliance on centralised architecture this marketplace creates a more equitable transparent system that can be built, and managed by its users.

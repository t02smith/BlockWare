Blockchain technology can be leveraged for distributed cloud storage to provide both public and private storage. In table~\ref{tab:blockhain cloud storage}, I detail some examples of how blockchain has been used to create cloud storage platforms or supplement existing ones:

One gap found when researching these solutions was that few offered file versioning that would allow a user to view previous versions of uploaded data. File versioning is an essential part of my application and it will be likely that users will have varying versions of the same game.

  Blockchain Based Data Integrity Verification in P2P Cloud Storage~\cite{yue_blockchain_2018}
  & This paper uses Merkle trees to help verify the integrity of data within a P2P blockchain cloud storage network as well as looking at how different structures of Merkle trees effect the performance of the system.

  Deduplication with Blockchain for Secure Cloud Storage~\cite{li_deduplication_2018}
  & This paper describes a deduplication scheme that uses the blockchain to record storage information and distribute files to multiple servers. This is implemented as a set of smart contracts.

  Block-secure: Blockchain based scheme for secure P2P cloud storage~\cite{li_block-secure_2018}
  & A distributed cloud system in which users divide their own data into encrypted chunks and upload those chunks randomly into the blockchain, P2P network.

  Blockchain-Based Medical Records Secure Storage and Medical Service Framework~\cite{chen_blockchain-based_2018}
  & Describes a secure and immutable storage scheme to manage personal medical records as well as a service framework to allow for the sharing of these records.

  A Blockchain-Based Framework for Data Sharing With Fine-Grained Access Control in Decentralized Storage Systems~\cite{wang_blockchain-based_2018}
  & This solution uses IPFS, Ethereum and ABE technology to provide distributed cloud storage with an access rights management system using secret keys distributed by the data owner.

  Blockchain based Proxy Re-Encryption Scheme for Secure IoT Data Sharing~\cite{manzoor_blockchain_2019}
  & An IoT distributed cloud system for encrypted IoT data that uses a proxy re-encryption scheme that allows the data to only be visible to the owner and any persons present in the smart contract.

\section{Architecture}

This application is structured using the Model-View-Controller MVC pattern to create a separation of concern between its main layers. Figure~\ref{fig:impl-layers} shows a high level overview of the architecture and below I discuss the purpose for each.

\section{Downloading a Game}

Figure~\ref{fig:p2p-interactions} shows the standard sequence of events used for a user to download a game from this application. The developer will upload a game that is purchased by a user; this user will then proceed to download the game off of the developer using the commands described in Section~\ref{subsubsec:commands}.

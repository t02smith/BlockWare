\section{The Problem}
\label{sec:problem}

Video games are often large and highly popular pieces of software that are typically distributed for developers by a third party platform like Steam or Epic Games. Whilst these platforms provide benefits such as availability, and some social features they have some major downsides that include:
\vspace{1mm}
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
  \item taking a large cut of all revenue, \newline\textit{Steam take a 30\% cut~\cite{marks_report_2019,brown_valve_2021}}
  \item being vulnerable to censorship from governments, \newline\textit{The Chinese version of Steam is heavily censored~\cite{steamdb_steam_2021}}
  \item the user's access to their games is linked to the platform. \newline\textit{If the platform shuts down, the user loses all their games}
\end{enumerate}
\vspace{1mm}
% \noindent A blockchain-based, decentralised platform will provide greater profits to developers, eliminate the need for trust in a third party platform, and allow users greater control over the games they own as their access is not directly linked to one service.

\section{Goals}

The goal of this project is to implement a large-scale distribution platform that will allow game developers to release and continuously update their games on a public network by directly interacting with their users. Specifically, this application should allow:

\begin{itemize}
  \item developers to release and update their games on a distributed network,
  \item users to purchase games off of developers through the network,
  \item users to distribute the developer's game for them in return for a reward, and
  \item users to trust the data they download off of other users on the network.
\end{itemize}

\section{Scope}

This project will look at how the Ethereum blockchain and smart contracts can be used to create a large-scale distribution platform for video games. This will be deployed to a `testnet', where Ether has no value and applications can be tested in a live environment. Whilst the focus on this application is on video games, this should be a valid solution for software of all types.

The application will consist of a set of smart contracts, written in Solidity, with tests and a basic GUI to be written using TypeScript and React.js. Tools like Ganache and Truffle will also be useful for blockchain development.

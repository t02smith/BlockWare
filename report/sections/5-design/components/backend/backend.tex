The Backend can be broken down into two major components:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Networking} The creation and maintenance of network connections with other peers over the internet with the purpose of sharing data.
  \item \textbf{Data Manager} the management of local data and the processing of data received and to be uploaded by the Networking component.
\end{itemize}

\section{Discussion}

Due to the scale and complexity of the platforms this project was aiming to replace, this project was never going to be more than a proof-of-concept as to what a distributed games marketplace could look like. 
However, this application does have several benefits over its centralised competitors, which are outlined in Section~\ref{des:benefits}
\x
This project presents interesting ideas surrounding how games, and other proprietary software, can be distributed without the need for a middle-man. This follows modern web ideas of taking away reliance on large data-centres and having a system built and maintained by the people who use it. Moreover, this type of project is usually open source, which can help attract community contributions to improve the security and user experience of the application.

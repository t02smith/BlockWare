\section{Ethereum}

Ethereum~\cite{vujicic_blockchain_2018,dannen_introducing_2017} is a distributed transaction-based blockchain that comes with a built-in Turing-complete programming language that allows any user to design their own transactions. Each block in an Ethereum blockchain wil include a list of transactions that show the most recent state that can be calculated by any node by applying the smart contract code given for each transaction.

\subsection*{Smart Contracts}

A smart contract is an executable piece of code, written in Solidity~\cite{noauthor_solidity_nodate}, that will automatically execute on every node in the Ethereum network when certain conditions are met. Smart contracts are enforced by the blockchain network and remove the need for intermediaries and reduce the potential of contractual disputes.

Gas is used to measure the computational effort of running a smart contract and must be paid, in Ether, before being processed and added to the blockchain. This helps prevent DoS attacks and provides economic incentives for users to behave in a way that benefits the whole network.

\subsection*{Test Networks}

An Ethereum test network is an instance of the Ethereum network in which users can deploy their smart contracts and test them in a live environment. Ether for these networks can be gained for free from a faucet provided by a node from the network. Some notable examples include Sepolia~\cite{noauthor_sepolia_nodate}, Goerli~\cite{noauthor_goerli_nodate}, and Ropsten\footnote{The Ropsten test-net is declared as end of life as of December 2022~\cite{noauthor_ropsten_2023}}.

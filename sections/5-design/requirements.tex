\label{subsec:requirements}


Tables~\ref{tab:functional-requirements} and~\ref{tab:non-functional-requirements} show the functional and non-functional requirements of this project organized using MoSCoW prioritisation. 

\subsubsection*{Functional Requirements}

  \toprule
  \textbf{ID} & \textbf{Description}
  \\\midrule\midrule
  \multicolumn{2}{c}{\cellcolor{red!70}\textit{Must}}\\\midrule
  F\_M1 & Store software metadata on a blockchain\\
  F\_M2 & A node must request individual shards from its peers\\
  F\_M3 & A node must be able to discover peers who have their desired game installed\\
  F\_M4 & Software must be updatable through the blockchain\\
  F\_M5 & A node must be able to upload software\\
  F\_M6 & A node must be able to download software in its entirety from nodes in the same network.\\
  F\_M7 & A node must be able to verify the integrity of each block it downloads\\
  F\_M8 & The application should run on the Ethereum network\\
  F\_M9 & Users must be able to purchase games from developers over the network\\
  F\_M10 & Users must be able to prove they have purchased a game\\
  \midrule\multicolumn{2}{c}{\cellcolor{orange!70}\textit{Should}}\\\midrule
  F\_S1 & Seeders should have a way to prove how much data they have seeded\\
  F\_S2 & Seeders will only upload content to users who have a valid proof of purchase\\
  F\_S3 & Allow for the distribution of DLC for games\\
  \midrule\multicolumn{2}{c}{\cellcolor{green}\textit{Could}}\\\midrule
  F\_C1 & Allow users to request specific software versions\\
  F\_C2 & Provide a simple GUI for interacting with the blockchain\\

  \textbf{ID} & \textbf{Description}
  \\\midrule\midrule
  \multicolumn{2}{c}{\cellcolor{red!70}\textit{Must}}\\\midrule
  NF\_M1 & The application is decentralized and cannot be controlled by any one party\\
  NF\_M2 & Any user must be able to join and contribute to the network\\
  NF\_M3 & Game uploaders should be publicly identifiable\\
  NF\_M4 & Metadata required to download the game should be immutable\\
  \midrule\multicolumn{2}{c}{\cellcolor{orange!70}\textit{Should}}\\\midrule
  NF\_S1 & This application must be scalable, such that many users can upload and download the same game at the same time.\\
  NF\_S2 & Only the original uploader can upload an update to their game\\
  NF\_S3 & Only the original uploader can upload a DLC for their game\\
  \midrule\multicolumn{2}{c}{\cellcolor{green}\textit{Could}}\\\midrule
  NF\_C1 & The application could have an intuitive GUI\\

There are several things to note about using Ethereum as platform for selling games:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Ethereum is a less stable currency than most traditional currencies like GBP or USD so games may fluctuate largely in price.
  \item All write functions on the smart contract will incur a gas fee so uploading or updating data will not be free.
  \item Users will have to source Ether from elsewhere before being able to purchase games, which may be intimidating to users not already familiar with the ecosystem.
\end{itemize}

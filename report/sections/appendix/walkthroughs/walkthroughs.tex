\chapter{User Walkthroughs}\label{app:user-walkthrough}

This section will go through each of the acceptance tests outlined in Section~\ref{sec:acc-tests} and provide the evidence that they pass. This evidence will be given in the form of:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Smart contract transaction logs from the Sepolia test-net. These are public at \url{https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x2899dab55a4a20d698062bbf4d4ce9f1073ce052}.
  \item Copies of particular log entries that correspond to specific actions.
  \item Screenshots to show changes being reflected in the user interface.
\end{itemize}

# BlockWare Source Code

> This is for version 2.0 of the source code

What's Blockware? Well it's the platofrm that you're currently using to read this message. It's a decentralised video game platform that allows anyone to upload and sell their games over the Ethereum blockchain.

Some of the features include:

- A P2P network for downloading your games
- A library to view and manage your owned games
- A store (TBD) to discover and purchase new games

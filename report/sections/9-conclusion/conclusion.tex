\section{In Conclusion}

This project set out to demonstrate how video game distribution could be migrated to a distributed platform with the aim of reducing the risk of censorship, improving ownership and increasing profits for developers.
\x
By researching related topics and reviewing the literature around key areas of this project, I was able to combine many modern ideas and techniques to develop a functional proof-of-concept application. The heavy use of automated testing allowed me to continuously write robust and correct code.
\x
As most of the requirements set out in Section~\ref{subsec:requirements} were met, I can say that this project was successful in providing a proof-of-concept decentralised video game marketplace.

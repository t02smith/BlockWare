\chapter{Introduction}\label{sec:problem}

Millions of worldwide users enjoy video games, which are large pieces of software that require complex platforms to distribute them, which results in them being generally provided by multinational corporations. However this approach often results in these platforms:

\begin{itemize}
  \item taking a large cut of revenue from developers\footnote{Steam take a 30\% cut~\cite{marks_report_2019,brown_valve_2021}},
  \item being prone to censorship from entities like governments\footnote{See the Chinese version of Steam~\cite{noauthor_steam_nodate-1}},
  \item relying on a single platform to stay active, distribute games and maintain a user's ownership\footnote{The Nintendo eShop closing down prevents users from accessing games~\cite{noauthor_nintendo_2022}}.
\end{itemize}

Modern web technology allows for users to build and deploy their own platforms, which can be made with the users in mind and not financial gain or pressure from governing bodies. 

\section{Objectives}

This project aims to connect users and developers through a marketplace built using distributed technologies. Developers will be able to release and update their games to the platform, where users can securely purchase and download them. The platform will need to be public and accessible to all possible users around the globe and remove the need for any centralised architecture to maintain it.

\section{Scope}

This project will strictly focus on creating a distributed platform and will consist of the following components:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item An Ethereum smart contract that will allow for the maintenance of a library of games that can be queried and added to by any user. This will then be deployed to an Ethereum test-net.
  \item A local application to be run by users to interact with the smart contract and allow them to join a peer-to-peer P2P network where they can download and upload games.
\end{enumerate}

\newparagraph
This project will not present methods for preventing or stopping the distribution of illegal content or include tangentially related features such as achievements, or message boards.

\section{Sprint Plans}

Use of sprints will allow me to incrementally build my project up by considering the most essential requirements first. 
\x
For each sprint we will detail the planned requirements, whether they were completed or not, as well as any general comments about that sprint.

\subsection{Sprint 1}

The P2P distribution network was expected to be one of the most complex parts of the application so Sprint 1 was focused on getting the basics of it working.

% TODO This sucks just make a list
\begin{longtable}{ | p{.08\textwidth} | p{.34\textwidth} | p{.13\textwidth} | p{.34\textwidth} | }
  \hline
  \hdr{Req.} & \hdr{Description} & \hdr{Complete} & \hdr{Evidence}
  \\\hline
  \reqref{F-M2}
  & Downloading blocks from peers
  & \yes
  & Acceptence \& benchmark tests
  \\\hline
  \reqref{F-M5}
  & Upload blocks to peers
  & \yes
  & Acceptence tests
  \\\hline
  \reqref{F-M6}
  & Download the entire game
  & \yes
  & Acceptence tests

  \\\hline
  \reqref{F-M11}

  & \yes
  & Unit tests
  \\\hline
  \reqref{F-M12}
  & Generate Hash Trees
  & \yes
  & Unit tests
  \\\hline
\end{longtable}

\subsection{Sprint 2}

Sprint 2 was largely spent on two main aspects: creating the Smart Contract to store game metadata and start working on a user interface to show to the user. This sprint had a slower start due to me not being familiar with writing Smart Contracts and having difficulty in finding and learning a suitable GUI framework.

\begin{longtable}{ | p{.08\textwidth} | p{.34\textwidth} | p{.13\textwidth} | p{.34\textwidth} | }
  \hline
  \hdr{Req.} & \hdr{Description} & \hdr{Complete} & \hdr{Evidence}
  \\\hline
  \reqref{F-M1}
  & Store data on Ethereum
  & \yes
  & Smart Contract unit tests
  \\\hline
  \reqref{F-M8}
  & Connect to the Ethereum network
  & \yes
  & Smart Contract unit tests
  \\\hline
  \reqref{F-M9}
  & Purchasing games
  & \yes
  & Smart Contract unit tests
  \\\hline
  \reqref{F-M10}
  & Proving a game purchase
  & \yes
  & Smart Contract unit tests
  \\\hline
  \reqref{F-C2}
  & Provide a simple GUI
  & \yes
  & See Appendix~\ref{app:screenshots} for screenshots
  \\\hline
  \reqref{NF-M3}
  & Uploaders are publically identifiable
  & \yes
  & Smart Contract unit tests
  \\\hline
  \reqref{NF-M4}
  & Game data cannot be changed
  & \yes
  & Data on Ethereum is effectively immutable
  \\\hline
  \reqref{NF-S2}
  & Only the original uploader can release an update
  & \yes
  & Smart Contract unit tests
  \\\hline
  \reqref{NF-C1}
  & Intuitive GUI
  & \yes
  & See Appendix~\ref{app:screenshots} for screenshots
  \\\hline
\end{longtable}

\subsection{Sprint 3}

\begin{longtable}{ | p{.08\textwidth} | p{.34\textwidth} | p{.13\textwidth} | p{.34\textwidth} | }
  \hline
  \hdr{Req.} & \hdr{Description} & \hdr{Complete} & \hdr{Evidence}
  \\\hline
  \reqref{F-S1}
  & Proving the amount of data seeded
  & \yes
  & 
  \\\hline
  \reqref{F-S2}
  & Validate a user's ownership of a game before sending data 
  & \yes
  &
  \\\hline
\end{longtable}

\subsection{Incomplete Requirements}

There were several requirements, which were left incomplete due to a variety of reasons.

\begin{longtable}{ | p{.11\textwidth} | p{.29\textwidth} | p{.5\textwidth} | }
  \hline
  \hdr{Req.} & \hdr{Description} & \hdr{Reasoning}
  \\\hline
  \reqref{F-C3}
  & Discover peers based upon what games they own
  & This requirement was left incomplete intentionally due to the complexity it would have brought to the project. A solution could include using trackers, similar to BitTorrent, or a neighbour discovery algorithm.
  \\\hline
  \reqref{F-S3}
  & Allow for the distribution of DLC 
  & \multirow{2}{.5\textwidth}{DLC was left out of scope due to a combination of time constraints and an inefficienies within the update system that I felt should be resolved before implementing the DLC system. }
  \\\cline{1-2}
  \reqref{NF-S3}
  & Only the original uploader can release DLC for their game
  & 
  \\\hline

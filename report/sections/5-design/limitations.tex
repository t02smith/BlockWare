\section{Limitations}

\paragraph*{Social Feature}
This application will not contain any of the social features found in platforms like Steam. This includes things like friends, achievements, and messasge boards. 

\paragraph*{Availability}
Section~\ref{subsec:availability} highlights an issue of availability within P2P systems and this application will likely be similar. These could be mitigated by having an active community or good incentives but there is no guarantee when compared to centralised platforms. 

\paragraph*{Inefficient Updates}
Updates will be treated as individual games and will this require the user to donwload the entire game again. This is highly inefficient and will result in duplicate data being needed to be downloaded by the user.

\paragraph*{Hash Trees}
The main downside of a Hash Tree is that each file must have at least one block. This means that a large number of blocks may not necessarily correspond to a large amount of data.

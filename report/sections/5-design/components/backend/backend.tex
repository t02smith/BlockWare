The Backend can be broken down into two major parts:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Networking} the creation and maintenance of network connections with other peers over the internet and with the Ethereum blockchain.
  \item \textbf{Data Manager} the management of local data and processing of data received and to be uploaded by the networking part.
\end{itemize}

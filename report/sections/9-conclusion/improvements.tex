\section{Future Work}

\subsection*{New Features}

Some notable features that would serve as excellent extensions to this application:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Fleshing out the store page will make it easier for users to discover new content. Games could be given extra metadata to help make them more searchable.
  \item Allowing users to post reviews or posts to message boards for individual games will allow for greater community integration.
  \item Add customisable user profiles and allow for users to add each other as friends. Friends would auto-connect as peers to help maintain a network.
\end{itemize}


\subsection*{Optimisations}

There are several optimisations we could add to improve the overall performance and scalability of the application:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Peer Reputation} By ranking peers based upon their reliability we can improve the success rate and latency of requests we send. An optimistic unchoking algorithm like seen in BitTorrent could also be used.
  \item \textbf{Block Selection} Currently blocks are not ranked in any way but by considering ideas from Section~\ref{sec:bittorrent} we could improve the efficiency, availability and throughput of our network.
\end{itemize}

\section{Plan of Future Work}

\subsection*{Implementation \& Testing}
This phase I will use the agile development methodology to build my application. My sprints will all be structured into three phases:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Preparation} Deciding on the set of requirements to complete and making any initial design decisions and diagrams,
  \item \textbf{Implementation} using test-driven development, I will work on requirements based on their prioritization, and
  \item \textbf{Review} I will discuss the completed work in that sprint including design choices, what was completed, and any issues.  
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Testing Strategy and Results}
This phase will consists of several sections:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Testing Strategy} The approach I used for writing tests throughout the implementation phase and how these were used to evaluate the completion of the requirements set out in Section~\ref{subsec:requirements}. 
  \item \textbf{Test Results} A report on the results of my automated and manual testing.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Evaluation}
This phase will have me evaluating how successful my project was, as a whole, by focusing on several key areas:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Project Organisation} How successfully did I structure my time in this project?
  \item \textbf{Outcome of the Application} How successful was my application in regards to a solution to the problem set out in Section~\ref{sec:problem} and in terms of the requirements set out in Section~\ref{subsec:requirements}?
  \item \textbf{Limitations and Future Improvements} What were the limitations of my project and what would I change about it if I had more time or were to start again?
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Leftover Time}

In Figure~\ref{fig:final-gantt}, you'll notice there is a large period of time at the end where nothing has been planned. This has been to done to allow some extra time where certain things take longer than expected or new things need to be added that weren't taken into account before. It also means that all of the items on my risk assessment in Section~\ref{sec:risk-assessment} have the time to be resolved without affecting my project.

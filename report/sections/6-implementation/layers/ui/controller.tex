\subsubsection*{Controller}

The Wails package allows us to write controller functions in Go that are callable from our frontend code. These functions can be used to fetch data and trigger events in the backend code. This package also allows us to emit events that can be watched by the frontend; this will allow us to easily create a reactive user interface.

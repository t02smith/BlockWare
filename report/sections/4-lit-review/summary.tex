\section{Summary}

The literature has shown that a combination of a P2P file-sharing protocol and blockchain technology can offer dependable and secure distribution of data. However, these platforms fail to account for common use-case of selling access to data. This project will address this gap and allow access rights to be dynamically allocated through a large network of users that is secured using blockchain technology and enforced throughout a P2P file-sharing network.

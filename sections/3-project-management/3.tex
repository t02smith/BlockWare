\section{Work to Date}

My work has primarily been on research, looking at how blockchain has been used to build and supplement cloud storage systems as well as how various peer-to-peer functioned and performed. 
I have proposed a design for the application to be built on the EVM.

\section{Plan of Future Work}

\paragraph{Implementation \& Testing}
This phase I will use the agile development methodology to build my application. My sprints will all be structured into three phases:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Preparation} Deciding on the set of requirements to complete and making any initial design decisions and diagrams,
  \item \textbf{Implementation} using test-driven development, I will work on requirements based on their prioritization, and
  \item \textbf{Review} I will discuss the completed work in that sprint including design choices, what was completed, and any issues.  
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Testing Strategy and Results}
This phase will be used to discuss my strategy for testing and how it affected the overall success of my project. This will also be supplemented by a series of test results that show how my application fared against the tests I ran, including a discussion on any noteworthy test results. 

\paragraph{Evaluation}
This phase will focus on me critically reflecting aspects of my project and will be used to discuss questions such as:

\begin{itemize}
  \item How does my application fare as a solution to the initial problem?
  \item What changes to the application would make it more successful?
  \item What are the limitations of the application?
  \item What issues did I have during this project?
  \item If I were to do this project again, what would I change?
\end{itemize}

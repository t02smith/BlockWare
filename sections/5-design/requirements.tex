  \multicolumn{2}{c}{\cellcolor{red!70}\textit{Must}}\\\midrule
  F\_M1 & Store software metadata on a blockchain, including a reference to a previous block where appropriate\\
  F\_M2 & A node must request individual shards from its peers\\
  F\_M3 & A node must be able to discover peers relevant to the software it wants\\
  F\_M4 & Software must be updatable through the blockchain\\
  F\_M5 & A node must be able to upload software\\
  F\_M6 & A node must be able to download software in its entirety from nodes in the same network.\\
  F\_M7 & A node must be able to verify the integrity of each block it downloads\\
  \midrule\multicolumn{2}{c}{\cellcolor{orange!70}\textit{Should}}\\\midrule
  F\_S1 & Allow users to restrict their software to only a specific set of nodes\\
  F\_S3 & Allow a node to prove they have helped distribute software\\

  F\_C1 & Allow users to request specific software versions\\
  F\_C2 & Allow nodes to join groups for automatic identity verification\\

  NF\_M1 & The application is decentralized and cannot be controlled by any one party\\
  NF\_M2 & Any user must be able to join and contribute to the network\\
  NF\_M3 & Users should remain anonymous to other nodes in the network. However, to provide incentives and proof-of-purchase nodes will need to be identified by an uploader. \\
  \midrule\multicolumn{2}{c}{\cellcolor{orange!70}\textit{Should}}\\\midrule
  NF\_S1 & This application must be scalable, such that many users can upload and download the same software at the same time.\\
